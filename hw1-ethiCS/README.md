# Homework #1: Embedded EthiCS in Programming Language

## Descriptions

To give you an experience in ethical reasoning, we would like
to invite you to work on an optional writing assignment for **bonus** points.

Choose a programming language with which you are familiar, and discuss:

* Which features of this language make it usable? and for whom?
* Is there a way in which it could be made more usable (e.g. better documentation, more intuitive design, etc.)?

Write an essay about your discussion. You can write the essay both in Korean and English. 
There is no restriction on the format and length of the essay.
